"Today, I've worked on the color palettes, the fonts, the wireframe for the layout, and created AI generated images. As far as how I'm doing while creating this. I'm letting him help me. So far, I've changed the color scheme, and he approves of the cool graphic that was made. We both had a 'that's the one' moment. I need to change some of the fonts and positioning but It's coming along. A year ago, he came to my house for Thanksgiving, and he was not doing ok. I could tell. I asked but he wouldn't answer. I remember looking at him from across the room and he was staring off in front of him and I keep replaying this scene. What was going through his mind? I didn't do enough to reach out and it haunts me. I should have done more. It would be one of the last three times that he would be around me. I got to hug him, kiss him, and tell him I loved him."

"I thought I did more documentation of what I had done this week. I have a favicon and a delete button toggle, so entries don't get accidentally deleted. I worked for hours trying to get the journal to look nice, changed the whole layout from a side nav bar to a nav bar that is above the main layout. Trying to line up all the elements just sucks the hours away and now it is time for bed. I'm sad another entry didn't stay. I don't know what happened. It was about William. I hope next week brings more succes."
