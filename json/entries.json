I'm letting him help me. So far, I've changed the color scheme, and he approves of the cool graphic that was made. We both had a \"that's the one\" moment. I need to change some of the fonts and positioning but It's coming along.\n\nA year ago, he came to my house for Thanksgiving, and he was not doing ok. I could tell. I asked but he wouldn't answer. I remember looking at him from across the room and he was staring off in front of him and I keep replaying this scene. What was going through his mind? I didn't do enough to reach out and it haunts me. I should have done more. It would be one of the last three times that he would be around me. I got to hug him, kiss him, and tell him I loved him.",
